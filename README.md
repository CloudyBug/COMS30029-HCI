# Advice from Lecturer 
> Slides, lectures and practicals are what you should focus on now. Understanding and being able to apply that material to scenarios and compare with other theories is what's important.

> But asking you to remember e.g. the names of the METUX spheres would be a waste of all of our time. You are not here to learn to memorise vocabulary.

>Key to doing well is to understand how to apply the taught ideas flexibly to analyse interactions, to understand differences between potential theories and approaches and the implications of approaching design or analysis using these different theories.

> marks for such basic memorisation only make up a small portion of the marks.

## Is writing about something a tangent

A heuristic: it is probably not a tangent if it contributes towards answering one of these questions: 

1) How does the design of **the system I am analysing** support or undermine the interaction?

2) How does the **interaction context I am analysing** support or undermine the interaction?

3) How does this theory shed light on ways we could improve **the interaction I am analysing**?

4) How does this theory shed light on negative or positive consequences of **the interaction I am analysing** for society, or for some group of users.

Re: "supporting or undermining the interaction": Remember the "What is Interaction?" paper and exercise. Supporting or undermining an interaction may mean making it more/less efficient, motivating, enjoyable, smooth, (and various other things: pick your interaction lens, make sure your theory tells you about it). 

If what you're writing does not answer those questions, it may be a tangent. 

Pay attention to these heuristics and to the mark scheme. 

The only other consideration is proportion: don't go off on a 3 page detailed explanation of some point if it stops you from having space to address other things on the mark scheme.

## AT subjects
Activity Theory: Picking a Subject, etc.

The strength and the difficulty of Activity theory is that you can analyse the same situation in multiple different ways, depending on how you choose the subject, tool, and object. Your job is to choose the frame of analysis that is most interesting and revealing for your case.

In particular when you choose the subject, you have two broad options in this coursework. Because you are analysing group work technologies, you could 1) make the subject an individual within a group of users who are collaborating on the same activity, or you could 2) make the subject the whole group of users working together. This choice will result in very different analyses.

What you need to understand, and make clear to us in the report are:

1) **Why is it interesting to analyse this scenario with a group as the subject, (or with an individual as the subject)?**

2) **Why is it interesting to focus on THAT group (or THAT individual)?**

3) **Once you have chosen a subject and a tool etc., you need to stay consistent with all your other choices.**  E.g. if two people in a group have a different mental model of a how a tool works that will be a primary contradiction if the subject is the group. It will be a secondary contradiction if the subject is just one of the individuals.
